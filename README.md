# physician_trajectories

This repo contains my final project for the class Complex Networks and Applications (NETS 5116) taught by Prof. Laszlo Barabasi, Dr. Brennan Klein and Dr. Rodrigo Dorantes Gilardi at Northeastern University which I took in Fall 2024.

The repo contains code for scraping a directory of US physicians (https://www.doximity.com/directory/physicians) and constructing and analyzing the bipartite network of US physicians and the institutions at which they trained.
