# physician_trajectories

This repo contains my final project for the class Complex Networks and Applications (NETS 5116) taught by Prof. Laszlo Barabasi, Dr. Brennan Klein and Dr. Rodrigo Dorantes Gilardi which I took in Fall 2024.

The repo contains code for scraping a directory of US physicians and constructing and analyzing the bipartite network of US physicians and the institutions at which they trained.
